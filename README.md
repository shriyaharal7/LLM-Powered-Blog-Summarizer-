# LLM-Powered-Blog-Summarizer-

In today's era of information overload on the internet, the ability to quickly grasp the essence of lengthy blog posts is crucial. This is where Language Model (LLM) technologies play a vital role, revolutionizing our approach to digesting and condensing large volumes of text. The undertaking titled "LLM-Powered Blog Summarizer: Exploring Cutting-Edge Techniques" delves into the realm of these sophisticated models.

Our journey begins with the extraction of pertinent information from extensive blog entries. Leveraging leading LLMs such as BART, T5, and Pegasus, we showcase their prowess in accurately and succinctly summarizing blogs.

Employing diverse LLMs, each employing its unique methodology, we generate concise summaries of lengthy blogs. Through the utilization of BART, T5, and Pegasus models, our aim is to identify the most effective approach and juxtapose their outcomes.

Under the hood, we evaluate the similarity between the summaries and a reference using cosine similarity, providing insights into the efficacy of our summarization techniques.
